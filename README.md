# head-first-ruby-notes

This is a repository which only contains reference notes taken during my readthrough of **Heads First Ruby**

### Interesting files

These are the files I found more interesting and will serve as a reference in the future

1. [arr](arr.rb) (it has a good implementation of BigDecimal to avoid float point arithmetic errors)

2. [blocks](blocks.rb) (talks about ruby blocks, whose tend to follow a recursive behaviour)

3. [get_number](get_number.rb) (A guessing game that use basic control structures, it's fun)

4. [inheritance_employee](inheritance_employee.rb) (has the basics of classes)
